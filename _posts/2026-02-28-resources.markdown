### Childhood: Unconscious Allocation

Think back on your childhood. Personally, I haven't thought about time, energy and attention back then. The only time I thought about these things was when I was tired, hungry or worried that I might come back home too late. But I never thought about these things as scarce resources. I lived in the moment, yet these constraints were always there, for all of us. We just didn't have the awareness to recognize them as such, but we all had experiences that were shaped by these limitations. 

We all stayed up too late playing games and feeling tired the next day. We all had to wait for our parents to come home before we could go out and play. We intuitively recognized our limits and adapted our behavior accordingly as we got older. And we all learned the consequences of ignoring these constraints - sometimes even choosing to ignore them because the immediate reward was worth it. 

All we really did is manage our resources in a way that felt natural to us, without consciously thinking about it. We made intuitive decisions on how to allocate our time, energy and attention based on our needs and desires. So for the purpose of this essay, I choose to define a resource as the following:

> **A resource is anything limited that you can invest, waste, or allocate - and that shapes the direction of your life.**

### Growing Up: Awareness of Consequences

As we grew older, we more and more became aware of the limits of our resources. It started by recognizing the short-term consequences of our actions - like feeling tired after staying up late, being unable to focus on important tasks, or failing an exam by choosing not to study. The consequences were immediate and tangible.

But maturity brought a deeper realization. Our decisions didn’t just affect tomorrow - they shaped years.

We began to understand that long-term outcomes are the result of repeated allocation. We learned that if we want to achieve our goals, we need to be mindful of how we invest our resources over time - that if we continuously spend time and energy on working out or eating healthy, we improve our health and well-being in the long run; that if we invest our attention in the wrong people or activities, we can end up in toxic relationships or harm our mental health; and that if we waste our resources on distractions and procrastination, we may end up feeling unfulfilled and regretful.

What we eventually discovered is simple but unsettling: **our resources are finite, and how we allocate them determines the direction of our lives.**

### Adulthood: Deliberate Allocation

Everyone has their own timeline for when they become aware of the scarcity of their resources. But we inevitably become aware that our time, energy, and attention are not expanding - they are narrowing. The older we get, the more visible the limits become. And with that visibility, choosing how to allocate our resources becomes more and more important. We all have to make trade-offs and prioritize what matters most to us. 

We begin to understand that life is not just about reacting to consequences. It is about deliberate allocation. Every choice becomes a trade-off. Every commitment becomes a filter. Every direction excludes another.

Maturing means recognizing certain structural truths about our lives:

- **Time is irreversible** - once spent, it cannot be reclaimed.
- **Energy is renewable but finite** - depletion without recovery eventually compounds.
- **Attention is selective** - focusing on one thing necessarily neglects another.
- **Commitment creates exclusion** - every "yes" contains a hidden "no".
- **Habits compound** - small, repeated allocations shape long-term outcomes.
- **Opportunity cost is real** - choosing one path closes countless alternatives.
- **Neglect is also allocation** - what you ignore will still shape your life.

Maturity therefore is the conscious alignment of limited resources with chosen values. It is deciding - deliberately and repeatedly - what deserves your time, your energy, and your attention.

Because once you understand that everything is allocation, you understand that your life is not built in grand moments, but in quiet, daily spending.

### Meaning: Scarcity Is What Makes Choice Matter

Have you ever played a game where you have to manage resources like currencies, had to wait for something to build and decided to give yourself unlimited currency or skip the waiting time? You might have felt a momentary thrill, but it probably didn’t last. 

The game lost its meaning because the scarcity that made your choices matter was removed. The challenge, the tension, the growth - all of it was gone. The game became hollow because the resources that gave it meaning were no longer scarce.

The same principle applies to life. If we could just buy more time, energy, or attention, or if we could just skip the hard parts, life would lose its meaning. The scarcity of our resources is what makes our choices matter. It is what gives our commitments weight and our values significance. It is what makes growth possible and achievement rewarding. Scarcity is not a problem to be solved; it is a condition to be embraced. It is the very thing that makes life meaningful.

### Conclusion: Embrace Scarcity, Choose Wisely

Embrace the scarcity of your resources, because it is what makes your choices matter. Be aware that in today’s world, your attention, your time, and your energy are constantly competing for capture. There are countless forces designed to fragment them. 

But within your limits lies your **agency**. 

You cannot expand time. You cannot eliminate trade-offs. You cannot avoid scarcity. But you can decide what deserves your allocation. 

And that decision - repeated quietly, daily - is what becomes your life.
